## Running the game

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.pyw" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

```sh
    python run_game.py
```

## How to play the game

You are the spirit of the room. The family living in your house got a
treasure, and hide it inside a "safe" place. Unfortunately, a burglar
decides to visit this house tonight.

As the spirit of the room, you can move some objects, and event change
the room's position in the house when no-one is inside. Do your best
to protect the treasure !

When you can interact with an object, the cursor's shape changes. If
clicking does not trigger anything, this means this could be done
later (or sooner) in the game.
