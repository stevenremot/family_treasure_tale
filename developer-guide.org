* Entity Component System
** World creation

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   from ecs import World
   world = World()
   #+END_SRC

** Components

   Components are simple python classes. Their type is given by their
   class.

** Entities
*** Creation

    #+BEGIN_SRC python
    entity = world.entity()
    #+END_SRC

*** Adding component

    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      from geometry import Positionable
      # ...
      x, y = 10, 20
      entity.add_component(
          Positionable(x, y)
      )

      # Several components at one time
      entity.add_components(
          Renderable('image.png'),
          Clickable(lambda: print "Hello")
      )
    #+END_SRC

*** Requesting world

    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      for entity in world.get_entities([Positionable, Renderable]):
          print entity.get_component(Positionable).x
    #+END_SRC
